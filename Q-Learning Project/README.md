The code for this project was adapted from the lecture notes for the module 'Dynamics of Learning and Iterated Games' at Imperial College London in the Fall term 2023. I think it originally came from "E. Akiyama J. P. Crutchfield Y. Sato. Stability and diversity in collective adaptation." or other papers from the author Sato.

The project is about the Q-Learning Dynamics in two-player games, and is focused on analysing the stability of interior Nash Equilibria. 


In the PDF file, the step-size for numerical integration was chosen too large, so we can see an oscillation along the diagonal - which is a mistake.
